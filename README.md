# Small Bank - Educational Java 17 and Spring Experimental Project

## Project Description

### Overview
Small Bank is an educational and experimental project designed to illustrate best practices in Java 17 and Spring application development, with a specific focus on implementing robust security measures using Spring Security. This project serves as a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application showcasing core banking functionalities.

### Project Goals

1. **Educational Focus**: Small Bank's primary objective is to provide a practical learning platform for Java and Spring enthusiasts. It offers hands-on experience in building a modern web application with Java 17 and the Spring framework.

2. **Real-World Banking Functions**: Small Bank replicates essential banking operations, including account creation, transaction processing, balance inquiries, and account management, crucial for any banking application.

3. **Security Emphasis**: The project places significant emphasis on security best practices using Spring Security. It includes features such as user authentication, authorization, session management, and protection against common security vulnerabilities.

4. **Clean and Maintainable Code**: Small Bank adheres to industry-standard coding practices and design patterns. It emphasizes code readability, maintainability, and scalability.

### Key Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can securely create accounts and log in using credentials. Passwords are hashed and stored securely.

- **Role-Based Authorization**: Role-based access control ensures that users can only access functionalities and resources they are authorized to use.

- **Transaction Processing**: Users can initiate transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts.

- **Account Management**: Users can view account balances, transaction history, and manage their accounts.

- **Security Measures**: The project incorporates security features like Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, input validation, and secure password policies.

### Technology Stack

- **Java 17**: The latest Java version provides enhanced performance and features.

- **Spring Framework**: Leveraging the Spring framework for building the web application.

- **Spring Security**: Ensuring robust authentication and authorization.

- **Database**: Utilizing a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for data storage.

### Who Should Participate?

- Students and learners interested in Java and Spring framework.

- Developers looking to enhance their skills in secure web application development.

- Anyone interested in understanding the basics of banking system functionality and security.
